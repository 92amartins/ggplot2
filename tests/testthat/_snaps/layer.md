# function aesthetics are wrapped with stat()

    Aesthetics are not valid data columns.
    x The following aesthetics are invalid: `colour = NULL` and `fill = NULL`
    i Did you mistype the name of a data column or forget to add `after_stat()`?

# computed stats are in appropriate layer

    Aesthetics are not valid computed stats.
    x The following aesthetics are invalid: `colour = NULL` and `fill = NULL`
    i Did you map your stat in the wrong layer?

# layer_data returns a data.frame

    `layer_data()` must return a <data.frame>
